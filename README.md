👥 Team Collaboration This project was developed collaboratively by a team of three, with responsibilities clearly divided to ensure efficient development, maintainable code, and a high-quality final product. Each team member owned a specific area of the application while working together through GitHub issues, branches, and pull requests.

👩‍💻Sofia — Enhancements, Documentation & Deployment Implemented extended functionality for viewing detailed daily forecasts Managed application deployment using Vercel Wrote and maintained project documentation, including this README Performed final testing and code review before submission
Collaboration Process Tasks were managed using GitHub Issues Each feature was developed in a separate branch Pull requests were reviewed by at least one team member before merging Regular check-ins ensured progress and resolved blockers early This structured approach allowed the team to work efficiently while following industry-standard development practices.
